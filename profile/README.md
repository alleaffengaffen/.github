My personal organization for playing with Kubernetes.

## Current Project

Currently I'm trying to build a K8s cluster from scratch using vanilla Kubernetes (kubeadm), plain VMs and the power of GitOps for some real workload I currently have lying around on a webhosting service.

Why? Because it's fun and you can learn a lot from doing it so.

Mono-Repo approach, if you are interested, see my [banana](https://github.com/alleaffengaffen/banana) repo and have fun reading short docs with a lot of typos ;).
